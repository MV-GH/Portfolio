  - Title: Notes application
    From: '2021'
    Until: '2021'
    Description: I was tasked with creating an application which has two frontends and
      two backends. One frontend is an android app and the other is a progressive web
      app. We had to create the same backend in Node.js and in Laravel and they have
      to be interchangeable with the frontend. I decided to create an application where
      you can log your notes.

  - Title: Internationaal project 06
    From: 2021 March 22
    Until: 2021 March 27
    Description: Originally we were assigned to do an international project but that
      was cancelled due to COVID19. So instead we got to chose instead our own project.
      We decided to create tinder like app, instead of looking for a date, you search
      for teammates you want to play a game with. You can filter on which games you
      want to match with other people with. Then you swipe and when two ppl match you
      can chat. There is no account registration, its linked with discord and then creates
      link where you can chat in discord with the person you matched.
